/** These are the bugs I found Sir Kim
Bugs:
1. The class name can’t have spaces since Java doesn’t allow multiple separate words as identifiers.  
2. The method should be written as "main" (all lowercase), not "Main".  
3. The String arguments need square brackets [] for the array.  
4. “System” is misspelled — the letter “e” is missing.  
5. A semicolon is required at the end of the print statement.  
6. The class is missing a closing curly brace at the end.
